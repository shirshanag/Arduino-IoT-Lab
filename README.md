# Arduino IoT Lab ðŸš¦ðŸ“¡

A collection of my Arduino and IoT projects â€” blending code, circuits, and innovation to build real-world embedded systems.

## ðŸ”Œ Projects Included

| Project | Description | Components |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| ðŸš¦ Traffic Light System | A basic timed traffic light controller using LEDs and Arduino. | Red/Yellow/Green LEDs, Arduino Uno, Resistors |
| Street Light using LDR | This project uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect ambient light levels. When it gets dark, the Arduino automatically turns ON an LED (representing a street light). When itâ€™s bright, the LED turns OFF, saving energy.                                                                | Led, LDR sensor, Arduino UNO,Resistors,
| Smart-Fan-system | This project uses a photo resistor, temperature sensor , arduino, servo motor. Based on the value of temperature sensor and photoresistor the servo motor operates When the sensors exceeded the  thresold value the servo motor operates | Arduino, resistor, Photo-resistor, servo motor, Temperature sensor  |
| DHT22 sensor | Interfacing DHT22 sensor using an Arduino | Arduino, DHT22 sensor |
