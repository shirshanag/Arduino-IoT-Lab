# Arduino IoT Lab ðŸš¦ðŸ“¡

A collection of my Arduino and IoT projects â€” blending code, circuits, and innovation to build real-world embedded systems.

## ðŸ”Œ Projects Included

| Project | Description | Components |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| ðŸš¦ Traffic Light System | A basic timed traffic light controller using LEDs and Arduino. | Red/Yellow/Green LEDs, Arduino Uno, Resistors |
| Street Light using LDR | This project uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect ambient light levels. When it gets dark, the Arduino automatically turns ON an LED (representing a street light). When itâ€™s bright, the LED turns OFF, saving energy.                                                                | Led, LDR sensor, Arduino UNO,Resistors,
